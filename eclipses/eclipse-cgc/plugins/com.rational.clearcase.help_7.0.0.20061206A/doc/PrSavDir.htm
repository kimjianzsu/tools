<h1>Save dirty editors before ClearCase operations</h1>

<p>This <a href="CCPrefs.htm">ClearCase SCM Adapter preference</a> specifies how the Rational
Developer product handles unsaved changes to
files under ClearCase source control.&nbsp;</p>



<p> If this preference is set to <b>Prompt to save all
editors</b>, you are prompted to save changes to files before performing
operations that modify files (such as <a href="Update.htm">Update</a>, <a href="UpdtView.htm">Update View</a>,
or <a href="MergeMng.htm">Run Merge Manager</a>) or operations that commit
changes to a VOB (such as <a href="Checkin.htm">Check In</a>, <a href="AddToSC.htm">Add to Source Control</a>,
or <a href="FindReso.htm">Find Resources to Add to Source Control</a>). A dialog
box lists all resources that have changed
but have not been saved. By default, all changed resources are selected; you
can clear the check boxes of any resources that you do not want to save.&nbsp;</p>



<p> If this preference is set to <b>Automatically save all editors</b>, all changes you have made to resources
are saved.&nbsp;</p>



<p> If this option is set to <b>Do nothing</b>, changes are not saved.</p>



<p> By default, this option is set to <b>Prompt to save all
editors</b>.</p>
