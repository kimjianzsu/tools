<h1>Delete elements&nbsp;</h1>

<p>When you delete a Rational ClearCase element in the Rational Developer
product, ClearCase checks out the parent directory, performs a <b>

cleartool</b> <b> rmname</b> operation in the VOB, and checks in the parent directory
if the <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt;
        Team &gt; Rational ClearCase &gt; <a href="PrParDir.htm">When parent directory is automatically checked out to move, rename, or delete an element</a></b>

        preference is set to <b>Automatically check in parent directory</b>. If the parent directory is
checked out when you delete files or folders, ClearCase does not check it in. &nbsp;</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 12">If you want to delete multiple Rational
        Developer files or folders in the same directory as a single change to
        the directory, check out the directory, delete the files or folders in the Rational
        Developer product,
        then check in the directory.

        <p style="margin-top: 12">If you are using ClearCase UCM, a delete operation
        always uses the current activity.
<p>Conflicts can arise if a developer working on a shared branch of
      ClearCase checks in the parent directory but not the corresponding
      changes. To avoid problems, set the <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt;
        Team &gt; Rational ClearCase &gt; <a href="PrParDir.htm">When parent directory is automatically checked out to move, rename, or delete an element</a></b>

      preference to <b>Do nothing</b> and check in all files or folders that
contain code changes related to the deleted files or folders, along with the source and destination directories.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12">If you cancel the checkout (<b><a href="UndoCOut.htm">Undo Check Out</a></b>)
of a directory before checking it in, the deletion process
  is cancelled also and deleted files and folders reappear. ClearCase does
not cancel the checkouts
        of files or folders in the directory that you are deleting. To avoid
problems, resolve any checkouts in that directory or any subdirectories before
you delete.
