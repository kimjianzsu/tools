<h1>Automatic checkout during a Save operation</h1>

<p>It is a good practice to check out files out before
 you edit them. However, if you edit a file within the Rational Software
Development Platform that is under
source control but is not checked out, WebSphere Studio checks out the file
if <b>Automatically
checkout</b>  is the current setting of the <b>When checked-in files are saved
by an internal editor</b> <a href="CCPrefs.htm">preference</a>.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><b>Attention: </b>If you are using a shared branch in a dynamic view, the
  automatic check out process could create a potential conflict. While you are
  editing a file that is not checked out, another project team member can
  check out, edit, and check in the same file before you attempt to save it.

  When you save the file, the automatic check out process silently checks
  out the latest version of it and when you check in the file, your edits overwrite the previous
  edits made by the other team member. To avoid problems, always check out files
  before editing them.</p>
