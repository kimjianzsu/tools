<h1>Importing an Eclipse Team Project Set</h1>

<p>To import an Eclipse Team Project Set, take the following steps</p>

<ol>

  <li>In Eclipse, click <b>File &gt; Import</b>.<br>

  </li>

  <li>If you are using Eclipse 3.2x, click <b>Team</b> <b> &gt; Team
    Project Set</b>.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    If you are using Eclipse 3.1x or 3.0x, click <b> Team
    Project Set</b>.<br>

  </li>

  <li>Select the project set file (.psf) of the project you want to import and
    click <b>Finish</b>.<br>
    <br>
    If the project set file is in a ClearCase VOB, the import process is
    complete and you can access the project through the ClearCase view you were
    using when you performed the import. If the project set file is not in a
    ClearCase VOB, proceed to steps 4 through 7.<br>
  </li>

  <li>The ClearCase View dialog appears. If you are not connected to ClearCase,
    click the <b>Connect to ClearCase</b> button.<br>
  </li>

  <li>The views that are currently running on your system appear in the
    ClearCase View dialog. If you want to select a dynamic view that is not
    currently running on your system, click the <b>Start a different Dynamic
    view</b> button and select the view to start in the Start View dialog.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Select the view you want to use to import the project set in the ClearCase
    View dialog.<br>
    <br>
    <b>NOTE:</b>  If the ClearCase Remote Client (CCRC) is also installed on
    your machine, your CCRC web views also appear in the ClearCase View dialog.
    If you select a CCRC web view, any future ClearCase operations you perform
    on the project set in Eclipse are accomplished through the ClearCase Remote
    Client.<br>
  </li>

  <li>Click <b>OK</b> to import the project set using the ClearCase view you
    selected<br>
  </li>

</ol>
