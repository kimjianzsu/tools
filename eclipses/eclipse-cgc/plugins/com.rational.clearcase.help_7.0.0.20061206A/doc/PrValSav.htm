<h1>When checked in files are saved by an internal editor</h1>

<p>This <a href="CCPrefs.htm">ClearCase SCM Adapter preference</a> specifies
Rational ClearCase behavior when you attempt to save a Rational Developer file that
is not currently checked out.</p>

<p>If you want ClearCase to
check out files without being notified, select <b>Automatically checkout</b>. The automatic checkout process is necessary
for Rational Developer operations such as refactoring.&nbsp;If you do not want ClearCase to
automatically check out files, select <b>Do nothing</b>.</p>



<p> You cannot change the
activity that is associated with the file during the automatic checkout. To
change the activity associated with a file, you must check out the file
directly.</p>



<blockquote>

  <p><b>Attention: </b>If you are using a shared branch in a dynamic view, the
  automatic checkout process could create a potential conflict. While you are
  editing a file that is not checked out, another project team member can check out, edit, and check in the same file before you attempt to save it.

  When you save the file, the automatic checkout process silently checks
  out the latest version of it and when you check in the file, your edits overwrite the previous
  edits made by the other team member. To avoid problems, always check out files
  before editing them.</p>



</blockquote>

  <p>By default, this option is set to <b>Automatically checkout</b>.</p>
