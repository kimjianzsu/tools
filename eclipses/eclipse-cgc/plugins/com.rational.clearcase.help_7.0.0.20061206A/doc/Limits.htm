<h1>Known problems and limitations</h1>



<p>The following list describes known problems and limitations associated with
the ClearCase SCM Adapter.</p>

<h3>Dynamic views and automatic checkout</h3>

<p>Within Rational Developer products, a few non-interactive editors may not check out
files when first modified. If one of these editors edits a checked-in file that
is under ClearCase control in the Rational Developer product, these editors automatically
check out the file when they save it. If you
are using a shared branch in a dynamic view, the automatic check out process
could create a potential problem. If you begin to edit a file that is not
checked out, another user might check the file out, edit it, and check in a new
version in the meantime. In this case, your changes overwrite the
other user's changes when you save the file. If you are using a
shared branch within a dynamic view, you must check out files before editing
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Using ClearCase tools to modify source files</h3>

<p>Java<sup>TM</sup> .class files can get out of synch because the incremental
compiler does not run when the user changes a file from any tool outside the
Rational Developer product (such as Notepad or ClearCase Diff Merge tools). If you modify a
file outside the Rational Developer workbench, right-click the element and click
<b>Refresh</b>.</p>

<h3>&quot;File has been removed from the file system&quot; error</h3>

<p>Under some circumstances, when you attempt to add a view
private file to source control, the Rational Developer product displays this error message: &quot;File has been removed from the file system.&quot; This
problem occurs only when the file is open in an editor. The file has not been deleted and this error message can be
ignored.</p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>When you perform a refactor operation in Eclipse or a Rational Developer
product, the ClearCase SCM Adapter may prompt
you with a list of files to check out. If you clear the check box associated
with any of the files in the Check Out Element(s) dialog box, the refactor
operation fails. The workaround is to allow the ClearCase SCM Adapter to check
out all the files, then undo the checkout for the files that you do not want to
check out.</p>

<h3>Files show as view-private after reconnecting to ClearCase</h3>

<p>When you disconnect from ClearCase, disable and then enable your network
connection, and then reconnect to ClearCase, your project files may appear in
the workspace as view-private. ClearCase menu options for the project may also
be inactive. The workaround is to wait until ClearCase services restart before
attempting to reconnect to ClearCase.</p>

<h3>Adding ClearCase to your perspective</h3>

<p>ClearCase menus may not appear in some perspectives in Rational Developer
products. The workaround is to manually add ClearCase to the perspective by
clicking <b>Windows &gt; Customize Perspective</b>, selecting the <b>Comments</b>
tab, and checking the <b>ClearCase</b> option in the Available Command Group
list box</p>

<h3>Failing to preserve case in mixed environments can produce compile errors</h3>

<p>When working in a mixed environment, take the following steps to avoid
compile errors caused by case-inconsistent file names:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Windows Control Panel, click <b>ClearCase</b>.</li>
  <li>In the ClearCase Properties dialog, click the <b>MVFS</b> tab.</li>
  <li>Make sure the <b>Case Insensitive MVFS</b> and the <b>Case Preserving</b>
    options are selected.</li>
</ol>

<p>If these options are not selected, you may experience compile errors because
the case of the file names is different.</p>

<h3>Refactoring and Renaming a Java package using Eclipse 3.2.0 fails</h3>

<p>If you perform a <b>Refactor -&gt; Rename</b> operation on a Java package
under ClearCase control using Eclipse 3.2.0, the operation fails because you not
prompted to check out the Java files contained in the package. The workaround is
to check out all the Java files in the package that will be affected by the
operation before performing the <b>Refactor -&gt; Rename</b> operation.</p>

<h3><img border="0" src="nglinux.gif" alt="Linux only indicator" width="49" height="13">&nbsp; Undo Hijack does not work after
saving changes</h3>

<p>An <b>Undo Hijack</b> operation performed on a file after you hijack, edit, and
save it does not work. The workaround is to check out the file and cancel the
checkout operation using <a href="UndoCOut.htm">Undo Check Out</a>.</p>

<h3><img border="0" src="nglinux.gif" alt="Linux only indicator" width="49" height="13">&nbsp; xclearcase crashes on Red Hat
Linux 8.x</h3>

<p>If you are running on any of the following platforms:&nbsp;</p>

<p>RedHat Professional 8 and 9, RHEL 2.1 and 3.0, or SLES9</p>

<p> ClearCase does not support a LANG environment
variable that contains <b>UTF-8</b>. If you use
ClearCase GUIs on these platforms, you must set the value of LANG in the <b>/etc/sysconfig/i18n</b>

file to a supported value, such as <b>C</b> or <b>en_US.iso885915</b>. After you
reset the LANG environment variable, verify that the SUPPORTED variable in the <b>i18n</b> file also
contains this value. If it does not, add this value to the SUPPORTED variable.</p>

<h3><img border="0" src="nglinux.gif" alt="Linux only indicator" width="49" height="13">&nbsp; Unable to install ClearCase or
apply patches under Red Hat Linux 8.x</h3>

<p>When you attempt to install ClearCase or to apply ClearCase patches, you see
this error message: &quot;Current directory incorrect.&quot;&nbsp; The
problem is actually with Perl and is not due to an incorrect directory. The
workaround is to install the Red Hat Linux 8.x package compat-db-3.3.11, which
provides libdb.so.3.</p>

<h3><img border="0" src="nglinux.gif" alt="Linux only indicator" width="49" height="13">&nbsp; Cannot move resource to a
non-versioned folder</h3>

<p>If you try to move a resource that is under source control to a
folder that is not under source control, the move fails and an error
message states that ClearCase failed to add the parent directory to
source control. The workaround is to place the destination folder under source control.</p>
