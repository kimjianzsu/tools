<h1>Working with dynamic views</h1>

<p>Dynamic views are automatically updated to reflect the latest changes in the
VOBs. Rational Developer does not always automatically synchronize with file
system changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deliver, rebase, and merge manager operations refresh the
workspace automatically when performed in the Rational Developer product. If the view changes outside of
the Rational Developer product, (for example, if you perform a deliver, rebase, or merge
manager operation outside of the Rational Developer product or if you perform a checkout, checkin, or merge
operation from ClearCase Explorer), you must refresh the workspace manually.</p>



<p> When using shared braches or streams, always check out files before you edit
them. For more information, see <a href="AutoChkO.htm">Automatic check out
during a Save operation</a>.</p>
