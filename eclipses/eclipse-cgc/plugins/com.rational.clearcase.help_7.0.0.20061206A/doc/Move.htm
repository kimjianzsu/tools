<h1> Move elements</h1>

<p>When you move a file or folder that is a Rational ClearCase element in the
Rational Developer product, ClearCase checks out the parent directory, performs the
move operation in the VOB, and checks in the parent directory if the <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt;
        Team &gt; Rational ClearCase &gt; <a href="PrParDir.htm">When parent directory is automatically checked out to move, rename, or  delete an element</a></b>
preference is set to <b>Automatically check in parent directory</b>. If a source or destination directory is
checked out when you
        perform the move operation, ClearCase does not
        check it in.&nbsp;</p>

<p> If you move an element between VOBs,
the version currently in your view is copied to the new location and removed from the old location.
The history of the element is not
        available at the new location and you are prompted to add the element to source control.
When you move an element between VOBs, the ClearCase SCM
      Adapter ignores the setting of the <b>When parent directory is
      automatically checked out to move, rename, or delete an element</b>
      preference.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 12">To move multiple Rational Developer files or folders
        that reside in the same directory as a single directory change, check out the directory, perform the
        move operations in the Rational Developer product,
        then check in the directory.&nbsp; If you are using ClearCase UCM, a move operation
        always uses the current activity.
<p>Conflicts<b> </b>can arise if a developer working on a shared branch checks in the parent directory but not the corresponding
      changes. To avoid problems, set the <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt;
        Team &gt; ClearCase SCM Adapter &gt; <a href="PrParDir.htm">When parent directory is automatically checked out to move, rename, or delete an element</a></b>

      preference to <b>Do nothing</b> and verify that all files or folders
      containing code changes related to the files or folders you moved are
      checked in. The source and destination directories must also be checked
in.

      <p style="margin-top: 12">If you cancel a checkout on a directory<b> </b>before checking it
      in by using <b><a href="UndoCOut.htm">Undo Check Out</a></b>, the move process
  is undone. If the source directory is not checked in before the checkout is
      cancelled, any files or folders that you moved out of the source directory
      reappear. If the destination directory is not checked in before the
      checkout is cancelled, the destination directory no longer
      contains the files of folders you moved into it.&nbsp;To undo a Rational
      Developer move operation in ClearCase, verify that neither the parent directory nor the renamed elements
      are checked in before canceling the checkout. After clicking <b>Undo Check Out</b>, right-click the
    parent directory in the Rational Developer product and choose <b>Team -&gt; Refresh Status</b>.
