<h1>Working with models</h1>

<p>To avoid data corruption when you work with partitions of a composite model
in Rational Software Architect or Rational Software Modeler, you should always
work in a synchronized workspace that contains all the partitions of the
composite, with each partition at the same revision level.</p>
<p>The following example shows what can happen if you work with partitions of a
composite model in an unsynchronized workspace.</p>
<p>In a configuration management system, a composite model is made up of two
model partitions, model X and model Y. Both models are at version 20. Model X
contains one package, P1. Model Y is empty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. User A checks out the two models, both
at version 20.</p>
<p>2. User A makes several changes to P1, and
moves P1 from model X to model Y.</p>
<p>3. User A checks in model X and model Y.
Both files are now at version 21.</p>
<p>4. User B has model X, version 20, in his
workspace and makes a change to P1. The configuration management system prompts
User B to either check out the existing version in the workspace (model X,
version 20) or the newer version (model X, version 21).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If User B selects the existing version in the workspace (model X, version
20), he might have to repeat the operation that prompted the checkout.</p>
<p>However, if User B selects the newer model version (model X, version 21), all
the changes that User A made to the model are lost when User B saves the model.</p>
