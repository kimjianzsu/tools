<h1>Find Resources to Add to Source Control</h1>

<p>To place Rational Developer files, folders, or projects under Rational ClearCase source control,
click <b>ClearCase
&gt; Find Resources to Add to Source Control</b>. ClearCase searches in the current
workspace and
in the current ClearCase view for any Rational Developer files,
folders, or projects that are not under ClearCase source control. While the Progress
Information dialog box is open, you cannot perform other actions in the Rational
Developer product until the search ends or you click the <b>Hide</b> button which dismisses the Progress Information dialog box but does not terminate the search.</p>



<p>Any files,
folders, or projects
that are not under source control are listed in the ClearCase Add Element(s) to Source Control
dialog box. You can then use the list to place any of these view-private
resources under source control.</p>



<p>This option becomes active after you <a href="CCConnct.htm">connect to
ClearCase</a>.</p>
