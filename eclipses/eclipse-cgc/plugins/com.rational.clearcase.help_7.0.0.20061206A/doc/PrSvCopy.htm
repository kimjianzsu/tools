<h1>Save copy of file with a '.keep' extension</h1>

<p><img border="0" src="ngwin.gif" alt="Windows only indicator" width="49" height="13">    This <a href="PrAdvOpt.htm">Advanced Options</a> preference
specifies Rational ClearCase behavior when you cancel a checkout. When this
preference is selected, a copy of each file element that was involved in
the Undo Checkout operation is saved and a <b>.keep</b> extension is appended to each file
name. If this option is not selected, the files that were
involved in the undo checkout operation are deleted and any edits that you may have made to
those files are lost.</p>



<p>This option is only available on Windows platforms and is on by default.</p>
