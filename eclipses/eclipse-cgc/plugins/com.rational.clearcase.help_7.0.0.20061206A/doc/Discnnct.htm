<h1>Working in disconnected mode</h1>

<p>To work in disconnected mode, take the following steps:</p>



<ol>

  <li>Update your snapshot view.<br>

  </li>

  <li>Disconnect from ClearCase by clicking <b>ClearCase &gt; Connect to
    ClearCase</b> to toggle it off.<br>

  </li>

  <li>Disconnect from the network.<br>

  </li>

  <li>Start the Rational Developer product but do not connect to ClearCase. You may need to clear
    the <a href="PrConnct.htm">Automatically Connect to ClearCase at Startup</a>

    preference check box.<br>

  </li>

  <li>Use the <a href="Hijack.htm">Hijack</a> option to modify files. Using this option makes
    read-only files in a snapshot view writeable.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Avoid operations that rename or move files as these are difficult to reconcile
    after reconnecting.<br>

  </li>

  <li>Reconnect to the network, connect to ClearCase (note that it may take several minutes before you can perform
    ClearCase operations), update the view by clicking <b>ClearCase &gt; <a href="UpdtView.htm">Update View</a></b>,

    resolve any hijacked files, and use the <a href="FindReso.htm">Find Resources to Add to Source Control</a>

    option.</li>

</ol>
