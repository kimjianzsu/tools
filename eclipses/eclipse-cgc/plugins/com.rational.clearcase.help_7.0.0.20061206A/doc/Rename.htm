<h1> Rename elements</h1>

<p>When you use the Rational Developer product to rename a file or folder that is under
source control, ClearCase checks out the parent directory, renames the
file or folder, and checks in the parent directory if the <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt;
        Team &gt; Rational ClearCase &gt; <a href="PrParDir.htm">When parent directory is automatically checked out to move, rename, or delete an element</a></b>
preference is set to <b>Automatically check in parent directory</b>. If the parent directory is
checked out when you
        perform a rename operation, ClearCase does not
        check in the directory after you rename the elements.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 12">If you want to rename multiple Rational
        Developer files or folders that reside in the same directory as a single directory
        version change, check out the parent directory
        out of ClearCase, rename the files or folders in the Rational Developer
        product, and check in the directory.

        <p style="margin-top: 12">If you are using UCM, a rename operation
        always uses the current activity.
<p>Conflicts can arise if a developer working on a shared branch checks in the parent directory but not the corresponding
      changes. To avoid problems, set the <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt;
        Team &gt; Rational ClearCase &gt; <a href="PrParDir.htm">When parent directory is automatically checked out to move, rename, or delete an element</a></b>

      preference to <b>Do nothing</b> and verify that all files or folders
      containing code changes related to the renamed files or folders are
      checked in to ClearCase, along with the source and destination directories.

      <p style="margin-top: 12">If you cancel the checkout (<b><a href="UndoCOut.htm">Undo Check Out</a>)
  </b> on the directory before checking it in, the rename process
  is also cancelled and file or folder names revert to their previous state. To undo a
      Rational Developer renaming operation in ClearCase, verify that neither the parent directory nor the renamed elements
      are checked in before canceling the checkout. When you are
      finished, right-click the
    parent directory in the Rational Developer product and click <b>Team &gt; <a href="RefrStat.htm">Refresh Status</a></b>.
