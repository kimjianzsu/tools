<h1>When checked-in files are edited by an internal, interactive editor</h1>

<p>This <a href="CCPrefs.htm">ClearCase SCM Adapter preference</a> specifies
Rational ClearCase behavior when you begin to interactively edit a file in the
Rational Developer product that is not checked out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to be prompted to check out the file before editing it, select <b>Prompt
to checkout</b>.
If you want to check the file out without being notified, select <b>Automatically checkout</b>.
If you do not want either option, select <b>Do nothing</b>.</p>



<p>By default, this option is set to <b>Prompt to checkout</b>.</p>
