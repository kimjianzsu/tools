<h1>When checked-in files are edited by an internal, non-interactive editor</h1>

<p>This <a href="CCPrefs.htm">ClearCase SCM Adapter preference</a> specifies ClearCase behavior when
the Rational Developer product edits a file that is not checked out. For example, the process of
refactoring can change several files in this way.</p>

<p>If you want to check the file out without being notified, select <b>Automatically checkout</b>.
If you do not want to check out the file, select <b>Do nothing</b>.</p>



<p>By default, this option is set to <b>Automatically checkout</b>.</p>
