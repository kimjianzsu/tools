<h1>Diff Merge Patterns</h1>

<p>To specify the merge tools to use for specific name patterns, select the <b>Windows &gt; Preferences &gt; Team &gt; ClearCase SCM Adapter &gt;
Diff Merge Patterns</b> option in the Rational Developer product to
display the Diff Merge Patterns preference page, then take one of the following
actions:</p>



<ul>
  <li>To use the ClearCase Diff Merge tools for files with a specific name
    pattern, click <b>Add</b>. In the Enter Diff Merge Pattern dialog box, type the name pattern in the
    text box and click <b>OK</b>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>To use the Eclipse Compare/Merge tools for a name pattern, take one of the following actions:
    <ul>
      <li>Select the name pattern in the list box and click <b>Remove</b></li>
      <li>Clear
        the check box next to the pattern name to ignore a name pattern without removing it from the list
        box</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Notes</b>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can use an asterisk ( <b>* </b>) to represent multiple, undefined
    characters<br>
  </li>
  <li>You can use a question mark ( ? ) to represent a single, undefined
    character<br>
  </li>
  <li>To search for a literal * character or ? character, the literal character
    must be preceded by the backward slash ( \ ) escape character in the
    pattern. For example, enter \* to search for an asterisk.<br>
  </li>
  <li>By default, the ClearCase Diff Merge tools are invoked for all file types
    because the default name pattern selected is <b>*</b><br>
  </li>
  <li>Some file types only support the Eclipse Compare/Merge tools and the name
    patterns for those file types are ignored</li>
</ul>



<p>This option is active if you have the IBM Compare and Merge plugin
installed on your machine.</p>
