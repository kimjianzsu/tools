<h1>Managing workspaces</h1>

<p>Create a separate Rational Developer product workspace for each ClearCase view. Store
each workspace directory on the local file system and not under source control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do not recommend placing the Eclipse workspace directory in a view-private
directory. If you create projects in the default location under the workspace
directory, ClearCase prompts to add the project to source control. This process
requires all parent directories to be under source control including the
workspace directory. Instead, create workspace directories outside of a
ClearCase view. If you want to create projects under source control, you should
clear the <b>Use default location</b> checkbox in the project creation dialog
and navigate to a path in a VOB.</p>



<p>Use a
standard location for your workspaces such as, for example, <b>D:\Workspaces</b>. It is good
practice to verify that
your workspace name matches the name of the associated ClearCase view. For example,
for the Development view associated with the Rel3 project, the workspace name
could be: <b>D:\Workspaces\&lt;<i>user_name&gt;</i>_Rel3_dev</b> .</p>



<p>To specify a workspace, select the workspace in the Workspace Launcher window
that appears when you start the Rational Developer product. To move between
workspaces, use the <b>File &gt; Switch Workspace</b> option in the Rational
Developer product.</p>
