<h1>Working with metadata</h1>



<p>This topic provides information about working with metadata
in the Rational ClearCase SCM Adapter.</p>

<h3>Metadata files under source control</h3>

<p>It is good practice to place the following files under ClearCase source control, so that they reside either in a staging VOB or in their development location:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

  <li>All files that are part of a software release</li>

  <li>All <b>.project</b> files&nbsp;</li>

  <li>All <b>.classpath</b> files</li>

  <li>Tools and configuration files involved in the build process</li>

</ul>

<p> All <b> .project</b> files and <b>.classpath</b> files should be version-controlled in their development
location. When ClearCase prompts you to add the <b> .project</b> file or <b>.classpath</b>

file to source control,
click <b>Yes</b>.</p>

Do not place <b>.serverPreferences</b> files under source control.
<p>If you are using ClearCase UCM, you can ensure consistent changes to the classpath by allowing changes only in the
    Integration stream.

<h3>Server templates</h3>

<p>You can store server information in ClearCase as a template file. The actual server
configurations are kept local, but their history is preserved.</p>
