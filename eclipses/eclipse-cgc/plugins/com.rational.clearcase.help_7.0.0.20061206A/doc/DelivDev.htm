<h1>Delivering from a development stream</h1>

<p>The Deliver Stream option enables you to deliver and integrate change sets to
the integration stream once an activity has been completed. For example, if your
task was to create a new feature A, you can deliver a change set relating only
to new feature A into the integration stream.</p>



<p>To deliver from a development stream, select the <b>ClearCase
&gt; <a href="DelivStr.htm">Deliver Stream</a></b>  option or the Deliver Stream
<a href="CCIcons.htm">icon</a> on the toolbar. Select the
development stream that you would like to deliver to. Whenever you checked in a set
of changes into Rational ClearCase, you
specified the activities that you performed. You can
choose which activities you would like to
deliver into the integration stream. For example, your changes may have implemented
feature A, and now you can choose to deliver only changes relating to feature A. You can also specify the stream
that you would like to deliver the changes to. After delivery, Rational
ClearCase enables you to examine the
integration stream with the changes. When you have tested your changes and you are satisfied with the results of
the merge in the integration view, check in
the code by selecting <b>Complete</b>  in the Deliver Stream dialog box.</p>



<p ALIGN="LEFT">As you deliver your changes to a stream, we suggest that you have two different
instances of Rational Application Developer open: one workspace will have your development workspace which contains the complete changes, and the other will
have the integration workspace open. If you invoke the Deliver Stream option
from the integration workspace, your changes automatically appear in the
workspace. If you deliver from your development workspace, you will have
modified the file system outside of Rational Application Developer.&nbsp;</p>
