<h1>Creating a standardized development environment</h1>

<p>This topic provides information about creating a standardized development
environment in the Rational ClearCase SCM Adapter. A standardized development environment provides a
consistent workspace, build process, and environment settings.</p>



<p>When possible, use Team Project Sets which allow developers to import multiple projects at one time and
do not require an understanding of project dependencies. See <a href="AddProj.htm">Import a Rational Developer project</a>
for information about importing team project sets.</p>



<p>You can use shared external JAR files for third party components. This
practice eliminates dependencies on local build environments and avoids incompatibilities
between versions of JAR files. A Rational Developer project must include all JAR
files that are necessary to build.</p>



<p>Placing external JAR files under source control allows you to use
a common classpath for the external JAR files. If you are using ClearCase UCM,
you can store in a common UCM component the JAR files that are shared between
multiple projects.</p>



<p>You can also use the <a href="CCPrefs.htm">Rational ClearCase Preferences</a> to
create a standardized development environment.</p>
