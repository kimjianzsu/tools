<h1>Rebasing in an integrated environment</h1>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If you are using ClearCase UCM, the <b>Rebase Stream</b>
option updates your private
Rational ClearCase development stream to include any changes made between the
last baseline you were using and the baseline that you choose to use at this
point. The baselines exist on the integration
stream. When you perform the Rebase Stream operation, you are effectively
merging changes from the integration stream
into your private development stream. This operation merges changes in the new baseline with changes you may have made in your
development stream but have not yet delivered to the integration
stream.&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">   To perform this operation, choose the <b>ClearCase &gt;</b> <a href="RbaseStr.htm">Rebase Stream</a>

menu option or click on the Rebase Stream <a href="CCIcons.htm">icon</a>. The Rebase Stream function
does not affect
versions of files that are associated with
any activities that are already underway but have not been delivered. Any file
system changes resulting
from the Rebase operation, such as new files, are automatically updated in your workspace.</p>

<p>This option becomes active after you <a href="CCConnct.htm">connect to
ClearCase</a>.</p>
