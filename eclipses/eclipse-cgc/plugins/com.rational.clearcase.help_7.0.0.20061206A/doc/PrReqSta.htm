<h1>Request status information on demand only</h1>

<p>If this <a href="CCPrefs.htm">ClearCase SCM Adapter preference</a> is
selected, the status of only those elements
that you are currently viewing is updated in the Rational Developer product, rather that updating the
status of all the elements in your project. If fewer than fifty files or folders
are not under source control, you are prompted to add them. If more than fifty
files or folders are not under source control, click <a href="FindReso.htm">Find Resources to Add to Source Control</a> 
to identify them.</p>

<p>The accelerator keys for this option are <b>Alt </b>+ <b> Q</b>.&nbsp;</p>



<p> This option is on by
default.</p>
