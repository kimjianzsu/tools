        <h2>-- Configuring File Sets --</h2>
        <p>In the <a href="basic_setup_project.html" shape="rect">getting started section</a> we configured our
            project using the simple configuration approach. <br /> With the simple configuration all
            files in your project get checked by the same check configuration.</p>
        <p>
<img src="images/properties_simple_checked.png" alt="Checkstyle Properties Page" />
            <br /> Using the simple project configuration might suite you in most cases there are
            cases where you might need more control:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>You only want to check certain files based on the file name or exclude files
                    based on the file name</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You want to check parts of your project with one check configuration and another
                    part of your project with another check configuration</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To give you fine grained control over which files get checked with which check
            configuration the plug-in allows you to configure file sets. <br /> A File Set is a
            collection of files within one project that need to be checked with the same Check
            Configuration. A File Set is defined using regular expressions to select the files to
            include and exclude from the File Set.</p>
        <p>Deselect the check box <i>Use simple configuration</i> on the upper right of the
            Checkstyle Properties Page.</p>
        <p>
<img src="images/properties_advanced.png" alt="Checkstyle Properties Page advanced" />
            <br /> Now a table is displayed containing all file sets configured for this project.
            <br /> There is already a default file set named <i>all</i> in the table. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>To create a new file set click the <i>Add...</i> button, to edit an existing file set
            select the file set in question and use the <i>Edit...</i> button: <br /> Both actions
            will result in the Checkstyle File Set Editor opening.</p>
        <p>
<img src="images/file_set_editor.png" alt="Checkstyle File Set Editor" />
            <br /> Each File Set is given a unique name and a Check Configuration. Select from the
            drop down list the Check Configuration you want used when this File Set is audited.
            <br /> If no Check Configurations appear in the drop down list then you will need to
            first create one. See <a href="basic_creating_config.html" shape="rect">Creating a Check
                Configuration</a> for information on how to create a Check Configuration.</p>
        <p>Next, enter a series of <a href="advanced_regularexpressions.html" shape="rect">regular
            expressions</a> to select which files you want to include in the File Set. Each regular
            expression can be used to include or exclude files (the default regular expressions
            matches all files ending with ".java"). <br /> The regular expression
            is matched against the fully qualified file name within the project. <br /> That is, the
            entire path to the file starting with the name of the top level folder within the
            project and progressing through each folder down to the file, with '/'
            being used as the path separator. <br /> For example, consider the project in the figure
            below. The <span class="code-blue">CheckstylePlugin.java</span> file has a complete path
            of <b>
                <span class="code-blue">src/com/atlassw/tools/eclipse/checkstyle/CheckstylePlugin.java</span>
            </b>
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/package_tree.gif" alt="Package Explorer" />
        </p>
        <p>The include/exclude setting of the <b>
                <i>last</i>
            </b> regular expression a file matches will determine if the file is included in or
            excluded from the File Set. <br /> This lets you create a regular expression that matches
            a number of files and then refine the selection with a series of exclusion expressions.
            <br /> To adjust the order of the regular expressions use the Up and Down buttons to move
            the selected expression up or down in the list. <br /> The bottom section of the
            Checkstyle File Set Editor shows which files from your project are included in your file
            set based on the current settings. <br /> This section will update as you change the
            regular expression patterns and their include/exclude state.</p>
        <p>Each project in your Eclipse workspace can have any number of File Sets defined, each
            with a different set of files and each with a different Check Configuration. <br /> You
            can also turn off the checking of a File Set using the Enabled check box in the
            properties window.</p>
