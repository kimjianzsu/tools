        <h2>-- Expanding Properties within Checkstyle configuration files --</h2>
        <p>Checkstyle contains a <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config.html#Properties" shape="rect">feature</a> that lets you define module properties in a way that they can expanded
            dynamically when the configuration is loaded. <br /> Such a property is defined using the
            well known <span class="code-blue">${property_name}</span> notation.</p>
        <p>Normally these properties are resolved from command line or ant properties. <br /> Of
            course this does not work within the plug-in so using a checkstyle configuration
            containing such expandable properties will probably fail.</p>
        <p>But as you might have thought there are some features in place to help you out in this
            case.</p>
        <p>When a Check Configuration is set up the plugin will check the Checkstyle configuration
            file for unresolved properties.<br />When found the plugin will warn you that this
            configuration cannot be used until those properties can be resolved.<br /> To resolve
            such properties you have a variety of options. </p>
        <h3>Built-in properties</h3>
        <p>First there are some properties that are automatically expanded by the plug-in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
<span class="code-blue">${basedir}</span> - gets mapped to the current project
                    directory</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
<span class="code-blue">${project_loc}</span> - same as <span class="code-blue">${basedir}</span>
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
<span class="code-blue">${workspace_loc}</span> - gets mapped to the current
                    Eclipse workspace directory</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
<span class="code-blue">${config_loc}</span> &amp; <span class="code-blue">${samedir}</span> - get mapped to the directory the configuration file lies
                    in</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Resolving from .properties file</h3>
        <p>If you have more properties that need to be expanded there is another feature for you.</p>
        <p>Using External, Remote or Project Relative Configuration you can write the properties you
            need to be expanded into a <span class="code-blue">.properties</span> file that lies in
            the same directory as the configuration file and has the same name. <br /> For instance:</p>
        <p>
<span class="code-blue">D:/path/to/my/config/myCheckConfiguration.xml</span>
            <br /> can resolve properties defined in <br />
            <span class="code-blue">D:/path/to/my/config/myCheckConfiguration.properties</span>
</p>
        <p>Expandable properties within your configuration file will then be resolved from the
            corresponding <span class="code-blue">.properties</span> file.</p>
        <h3>Resolving from Classpath Variables and Environment properties</h3>
        <p>New in 4.1.0 is that you can resolve properties from Classpath Variables (set up in
            workspace preferences) and from Environment Properties.<br />Note that these need to be
            passed into the VM Eclipse runs on using the famous -D parameter.</p>
        <h3>Additional properties configured with the Check Configuration</h3>
        <p>If all this stuff doesn't suit your needs there is another option for
            you.<br />Reintroduced in 4.1.0 is support for storing properties with the Check
            Configuration setup.<br />You might have already noted the new <em>Additional
                properties...</em> button located in the lower left of a Check Configuration setup
            dialog.<br />Pressing this button will lead you to another dialog where you can input
            properties and their values<br />To aid in this task the plugin offers to find unresolved
            properties for you.<br />Properties set up here will be stored with the Check
            Configuration data, for Global Configurations within the plugins workspace state
            location, for Local Configurations within the <em>.checkstyle</em> file. </p>
        <p>Note that the plug-in supports 'property chaining' to let you use
            'properties within properties'. <br /> With this feature you can write
            something like this in your <span class="code-blue">.properties</span> file: <br />
            <span class="code-blue">property1=abc <br /> property2=${property1}def</span>
            <br /> Using <span class="code-blue">${property2}</span> in your checkstyle configuration
            will then be resolved to: <span class="code-blue">abcdef</span>
