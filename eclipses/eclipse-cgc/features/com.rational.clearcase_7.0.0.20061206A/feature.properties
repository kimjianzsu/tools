That level may be measured, for example, by the number of processors or \nusers. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for  future upgrade prices, if any, and \npotential special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, \nthen IBM may accept the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party \n(either IBM or its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it \nspecifies the name of the Program and the usage level acquired. \n\n"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity.\n\nThis Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any), \nLicense Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete agreement between \nYou and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written \ncommunications between You and IBM concerning Your use of the Program. The terms \nof Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent \nthere is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and those of the IBM \nInternational Passport Advantage Agreement, the terms of the latter agreement prevail.\n\n1. Entitlement\n\nLicense\n\nThe Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not \nsold.\n\nIBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully acquire it.\n\nYou may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) make and \ninstall copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The terms of this license \napply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all copyright notices and all other \nlegends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program.\n\nIf You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade You may \nnot use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another party.\n\nYou will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) \ndoes so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of this Agreement.\n\nYou may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided in this \nAgreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program \nexcept as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) \nsublicense, rent, or lease the Program.\n\nIBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. \nIf IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its PoE.\n\nMoney-back Guarantee\n\nIf for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the original licensee, \nYou may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if within 30 days of Your invoice \ndate You return the Program and its PoE to the party from whom You obtained it. If You \ndownloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You acquired it for \ninstructions on how to obtain the refund.\n\nProgram Transfer\n\nYou may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights and obligations to another \nparty only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement.

Charges\n\nThe amount payable for a Program license is a one-time charge. \n\nOne-time charges are based on the level of use acquired which is specified in the PoE. \nIBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified \nelsewhere in this Agreement.\n\nIf You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the party from whom You \nacquired it and pay any applicable charges. \n\nIf any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on IBM's net \nincome, upon the Program, then You agree to pay the amount specified or supply \nexemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal property taxes for the \nProgram from the date that You acquire it.\n\n3.
